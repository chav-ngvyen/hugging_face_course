        "The function that is responsible for putting together samples inside a batch is called a collate function. The default collator is a function that will just convert your samples to tf.Tensor and concatenate them (recursively if your elements are lists, tuples, or dictionaries). This won’t be possible in our case since the inputs we have won’t all be of the same size. We have deliberately postponed the padding, to only apply it as necessary on each batch and avoid having over-long inputs with a lot of padding. This will speed up training by quite a bit, but note that if you’re training on a TPU it can cause problems — TPUs prefer fixed shapes, even when that requires extra padding.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this in practice, we have to define a collate function that will apply the correct amount of padding to the items of the dataset we want to batch together. Fortunately, the 🤗 Transformers library provides us with such a function via DataCollatorWithPadding. It takes a tokenizer when you instantiate it (to know which padding token to use, and whether the model expects padding to be on the left or on the right of the inputs) and will do everything you need:"

        "Now that we have our dataset and a data collator, we need to put them together. We could manually load batches and collate them, but that’s a lot of work, and probably not very performant either. Instead, there’s a simple method that offers a performant solution to this problem: to_tf_dataset(). This will wrap a tf.data.Dataset around your dataset, with an optional collation function. tf.data.Dataset is a native TensorFlow format that Keras can use for model.fit(), so this one method immediately converts a 🤗 Dataset to a format that’s ready for training. Let’s see it in action with our dataset!\n",
